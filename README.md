# Getting Started with React Rampup

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### Install nvm

```nvm``` allows you to quickly install and use different versions of node via the command line.

I really recommend you install node and npm using nvm. This is the fastest, cleanest and easiest way to do it.

That way, you install NVM simply doing:

```curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.1/install.sh | bash```

To test that nvm was properly installed, close and re-open Terminal and enter nvm. If you get a nvm: command not found message, your OS may not have the necessary .bash_profile file. In Terminal, enter touch ~/.bash_profile and run the above install script again.

And you are now able to install node typing:

```nvm install <version>```

For example

```nvm install v16.10.0```

if you just want to install the latest node version, you can just type

```nvm install node```

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### What about the features of this project?
In this I have worked on React/redux and Github API for a github profile viewer webapp in which we can follow the users.
